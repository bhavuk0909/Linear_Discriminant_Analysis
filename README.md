# Linear_Discriminant_Analysis
Linear Discriminant Analysis or Normal Discriminant Analysis or Discriminant Function Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique which is commonly used for the supervised classification problems. It is used for modeling differences in groups i.e. separating two or more classes. It is used to project the features in higher dimension space into a lower dimension space.
